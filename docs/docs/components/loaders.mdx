### DirectoryLoader

Loading logic for loading documents from a directory.

The `DirectoryLoader` loads many documents at once from a folder. It saves you time and effort by automatically gathering all the documents in the folder and making them available for you to access.

**Params**
- **glob:** is used to specify the file pattern or pattern(s) that should be matched when loading documents from a directory. It allows you to filter the files based on their names or extensions.
```python
glob="**/*.md"
```
In the example above, only files with the .md extension will be loaded. Defaults to `**/*.txt`.

- **load_hidden**: it controls whether hidden files should be loaded or not. Hidden files are files that have a filename starting with a dot (e.g., .file.txt). By default, the load_hidden parameter is set to False, which means that hidden files will not be loaded. If you want to load hidden files as well, you can set the load_hidden parameter to True. Defaults to `True`.

- **max_concurrency:** it determines the maximum number of concurrent requests that can be made to load the documents from the directory. If you exceed this number, the loader will automatically queue up the requests and send them as previous requests complete. This can be useful when dealing with rate limits or when you want to control the number of concurrent requests being made. Defaults to** **`10`.

- **metadata:** it allows you to specify additional metadata that should be associated with the loaded documents. This metadata can be used to provide context or additional information about the documents.
```python
metadata = {"source": "example_data", "language": "Spanish"}
```
 In this case, we are specifying the source of the documents as "example_data" and the language as "Spanish". The dictionary can include any key-value pairs that you want to associate with the loaded documents.

- **path:** is used to specify the path to the directory from which you want to load the documents.

- **recursive:** it controls whether the loader should recursively search for documents in subdirectories of the specified directory. When is set to `False` means that only the files in the specified directory will be loaded. If you want to load documents from subdirectories as well, you can set the recursive parameter to `True`. Defaults to `True`.

- **silent_errors:** it controls whether errors encountered during the loading process should be raised or silently ignored. When parameter is set to False means that any errors will be raised and potentially interrupt the loading process. If you want to ignore errors and continue loading the remaining documents, you can set the silent_errors parameter to True. Defaults to `True`.

- **use_multithreading:** it controls whether the loader should use multithreading to load documents from the directory. When use_multithreading is set to `True`, the loader will use multiple threads to load documents concurrently, which can improve the loading speed, especially when dealing with a large number of files. When set to `False`, meaning that the loader will load documents sequentially without using multithreading. Defaults to `True`.

### EverNoteLoader

EverNote Loader.

The `EverNoteLoader` is designed to help you with a type of file called Evernote export files, which have the extension ".enex". These files contain lots of notes or pieces of information. It allows you to create a document for each note in the export.

- **metadata:** it is an optional parameter and should be a list of strings representing the metadata fields.
```python
metadata_fields = ["title", "created", "updated"]
```
The metadata_fields list is set to ["title", "created", "updated"], which specifies that you want to extract the title, creation date, and last updated date of each note. The loader will then load the notes from the export file and extract the specified metadata fields for each note.
