# Agents

Agents are components that use reasoning to make decisions and take actions, designed to autonomously perform tasks or provide services with some degree of “freedom” (or agency). They combine the power of LLM chaining processes with access to external tools such as APIs to interact with applications and accomplish tasks.

### Agent Initializer

The `AgentInitializer` component is a quick way to construct a zero-shot agent from a language model (LLM) and tools.

**Params**

- **Agent Type:** The type of agent to initialize. (Type: str)
- **Max Iterations:** The maximum number of iterations for the agent. (Type: int, Default: 10)
- **Memory:** Memory configuration for the agent. (Type: BaseChatMemory, Optional)
- **Tools:** Tools used by the agent. (Type: List[Tool])
- **Language Model:** The language model used by the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)

### CSV Agent

A `CSVAgent` is an agent that is designed to interact with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. CSV files are a common format for storing tabular data, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field. The CSV agent can perform various tasks, such as reading and writing CSV files, processing the data, and generating tables. It can extract information from the CSV file, manipulate the data, and perform operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregating.

**Params**

- **LLM:** The language model used by the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)
- **Path:** The path to the CSV file containing the data. (Type: str, File: .csv)
- **Handle Parse Errors:** Whether to handle parsing errors. (Type: bool, Default: True)
- **Agent Type:** The type of agent to construct. (Type: str, Options: zero-shot-react-description, openai-functions, openai-tools, Default: openai-tools)

### JSON Agent

The `JSONAgent` deals with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. Similar to the CSVAgent, it works with a language model (LLM) and a toolkit designed for JSON manipulation. This agent can iteratively explore a JSON blob to find the information needed to answer the user's question. It can list keys, get values, and navigate through the structure of the JSON object.

**Params**

- **LLM:** The language model used by the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)
- **Toolkit:** The JSON toolkit used to construct the agent. (Type: JsonToolkit)

### OpenAI Conversational Agent

Conversational Agent that can use OpenAI's function calling API.

**Params**

- **Model Name:** The name of the OpenAI model to use. (Type: str)
- **OpenAI API Key:** The API key to use for accessing the OpenAI API. (Type: str)
- **Tools:** List of tools to use with the agent. (Type: List[Tool])
- **OpenAI API Base:** Base URL of the OpenAI API. (Type: str, Optional)
- **Memory:** Memory component to use with the agent. (Type: BaseMemory, Optional)
- **System Message:** System message template to use with the agent. (Type: SystemMessagePromptTemplate, Optional)
- **Max Token Limit:** Maximum number of tokens allowed per conversation turn. (Type: int, Default: 2000)
- **Temperature:** Temperature parameter for generation. (Type: float, Default: 0.9, Range: [0, 2])

### SQL Agent

A `SQLAgent` is an agent that is designed to interact with SQL databases. It is capable of performing various tasks, such as querying the database, retrieving data, and executing SQL statements. The agent can provide information about the structure of the database, including the tables and their schemas. It can also perform operations like inserting, updating, and deleting data in the database. The SQL agent is a helpful tool for managing and working with SQL databases efficiently.

**Params**

- **LLM:** The language model used by the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)
- **Database URI:** The URI of the SQL database. (Type: str)
- **Verbose:** Whether to enable verbose mode. (Type: bool, Default: False)

---

### Vector Store Agent

The `VectorStoreAgent` is designed to work with a vector store – a data structure used for storing and querying vector-based representations of data. The `VectorStoreAgent` can query the vector store to find relevant information based on user inputs.

**Params**

- **LLM:** The language model to use with the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)
- **Vector Store Info:** Information about the Vector Store. (Type: VectorStoreToolkit)

---

### Vector Store Router Agent

The `VectorStoreRouterAgent` is a custom agent that takes a vector store router as input. It is typically used when there’s a need to retrieve information from multiple vector stores. These can be connected through a `VectorStoreRouterToolkit` and sent over to the `VectorStoreRouterAgent`. An agent configured with multiple vector stores can route queries to the appropriate store based on the context.

**Params**

- **LLM:** The language model to use with the agent. (Type: BaseLanguageModel)
- **Vector Store Router Toolkit:** Toolkit for the Vector Store Router. (Type: VectorStoreRouterToolkit)

---

### XML Agent

Construct an XML agent from an LLM and tools.

**Params**

- **Inputs:** Input text to pass to the agent. (Type: str)
- **LLM:** The language model to use with the agent. (Type: BaseLLM)
- **Tools:** The tools available to the agent. (Type: List[Tool])
- **Prompt:** The prompt template for the agent. (Type: str)
- **Tool Template:** Template for rendering tools in the prompt. (Type: str, Default: `{name}`: `{description}`)
- **Handle Parsing Errors:** Whether to handle parsing errors. (Type: bool, Default: True)
- **Memory:** Memory to use for the agent. (Type: Optional[BaseMemory])
