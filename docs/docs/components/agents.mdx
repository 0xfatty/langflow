The `AgentInitializer` component is a quick way to construct an agent from the model and tools.


- **LLM:** Language Model to use in the chain.
- **Memory:** Default memory store.
- **Tools:** Tools that the agent will have access to.
- **agent:** The agent to be instantiated. Current supported: zero-shot-react-description, react-docstore, self-ask-with-search,conversational-react-description and openai-functions.

### CSVAgent

Provides a convenient interface for working with CSV data by utilizing a language model and a toolkit of tools, allowing users to interactively manipulate and analyze the data.


- **path:** The file path to the CSV data.
- **LLM:** Language Model to use in the chain.

### JSONAgent

It is another custom agent that deals with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. Similar to the CSVAgent, it also works with a language model (LLM) and a toolkit of tools specifically designed for JSON manipulation.

- **LLM:** Language Model to use in the agent.

### VectorStoreAgent

This agent designed to work with a vector store, which is a data structure used for storing and querying vector-based representations of data.  Users can query, manipulate, and perform various operations on the vector store data using this agent.


### VectorStoreRouterAgent

The `VectorStoreRouterAgent` is a custom agent that serves as a router for vector stores. It utilizes a language model (LLM) and a toolkit of tools specifically designed for vector store routing operations.

### ZeroShotAgent

The `ZeroShotAgent` takes the `LLMChain` and the `Search` tool as inputs, using the tool to find information when necessary.

- **Allowed Tools:** Tools that the agent will have access to.
