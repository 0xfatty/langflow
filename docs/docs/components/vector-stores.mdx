# Vector Stores


### Chroma

Create a `Chroma` vectorstore from raw documents.

`Chroma` is an AI-native open-source vector database. The purpose of `Chroma` is to make it easier and more efficient for software developers to work with large amounts of data.

It offers several useful features for developers. For example, it allows them to add new data, retrieve existing data, update data that already exists, combine adding and updating data (called upserting), delete data, and search for specific data based on certain criteria.

One of the key features of `Chroma` is its similarity search capability. This means that the user can use `Chroma` to find items in the database that are similar to a given item. The similarity is determined using a mathematical concept called cosine distance. A lower score on the cosine distance indicates a better match between two items.

**Params**

- **Documents:** Documents to add to the vectorstore.
- **Embeddings:** Used to represent documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space.


- **collection_name:** It refers to the name of a collection of documents within the Chroma database. It is used to organize and manage the documents stored in Chroma. The collection_name is also used to identify and access the specific collection when performing operations such as adding, updating, or deleting documents. Defaults to `langchain`.

- **persist:** This parameter is used to control whether the data stored in the vector database should be persisted to disk or not. When persist is set to `True`, the data will be saved to disk, allowing it to be accessed even after the program or server is restarted. On the other hand, when persist is set to `False`, the data will be transient and will not be saved to disk. This means that the data will only be available during the current session and will be lost once the program or server is closed. Defaults to `False`.

- **persist_directory:** This parameter is used to specify the directory where the data should be saved when using the persistence feature. When initializing the Chroma client and setting persist_directory, the data will be automatically saved to the specified directory on disk. This allows the data to be stored persistently and accessed even after the program or server is restarted.

- **search_kwargs:** The parameter is used to specify additional search options or filters when querying the database. It allows the user to customize the search behavior and retrieve more specific results. Defaults to `{}`.

**Params**

- **Documents:** Documents to add to the vectorstore.
- **Embeddings:** Used to represent documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space.


- **api_key:**This parameter is used to secure the user deployment and prevent unauthorized access to the Qdrant cluster. When using a managed version of Qdrant, such as Qdrant Cloud, the user needs to provide an API key to authenticate and access the deployment. This API key acts as a security measure to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the Qdrant cluster.

- **collection_name:** It is used to identify and organize the data stored in Qdrant. When creating a new collection or accessing an existing one, the user needs to specify the collection_name to perform operations on that specific collection. It allows the user to manage and query the vectors and metadata within that collection.


- **content_payload_key:** This parameter refers to the key used to store the page content or text of a document in the payload structure. By default, the key is set to "page_content", but the user has the option to customize it and use a different key if desired. This is useful if the user already has a collection with a different key for the page content and wants to reuse it.

- **distance_func:** The parameter refers to the function used to calculate the distance or similarity between vectors. Qdrant supports various distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, cosine distance, and others. The distance function determines how vectors are compared and ranked in similarity searches. Defaults to `Cosine`.

- **grpc_port:** This refers to the port number used for gRPC communication with the Qdrant server. gRPC is a high-performance, open-source framework that allows remote procedure calls between client and server applications. By specifying the grpc_port, the user can establish a connection to the Qdrant server using the gRPC protocol. Defaults to `6334`.

- **host:** The parameter refers to the location where the Qdrant server is running. It can be either a local machine or a remote server. The host URL is used to establish a connection and interact with the Qdrant vector store.

- **https:** If true - use HTTPS(SSL) protocol. Defaults to `False`.

- **location:** This parameter refers to the storage location of the vector data. In the context of Qdrant, there are two possible locations for storing vectors: in-memory and on-disk. Defaults to `:memory:`.

    - In-memory storage: In some testing scenarios and quick experiments, it may be preferred to keep all the data in memory only. This means that the vector data is stored in the computer's RAM and will be lost when the Qdrant client is destroyed. This option is suitable for storing a small amount of vectors and is often used for testing and debugging purposes.

    - On-disk storage: Qdrant also supports storing vectors on disk, which allows the data to be persisted between runs. This means that even if the Qdrant client is destroyed, the vector data will still be available when the client is restarted. On-disk storage is useful when working with larger amounts of vector data that need to be preserved for future use.

- **metadata_payload_key:** The parameter refers to the key used to store metadata in the payload structure of a document. If the user wants to use a different key for the metadata, the user can set the "metadata_payload_key" to a desired value. This allows the user to store and retrieve specific metadata associated with each document in the Qdrant vector store. Defaults to `metadata`.

- **path:** Path in which the vectors will be stored while using local mode. 

- **port:** It refers to the network port that is used to establish a connection with the Qdrant server. The specific port number will depend on how Qdrant is deployed and configured. When connecting to a local Qdrant server, the port can be specified in the URL used to establish the connection. Defaults to `6333`.

- **prefer_grpc:** This parameter determines the preferred communication protocol to use when connecting to the Qdrant server. GRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, language-agnostic framework for remote procedure calls. When prefer_grpc is set to `True`, the Qdrant client will attempt to use the GRPC protocol for communication with the server. If GRPC is not available or not supported, the client will fall back to other available protocols. This parameter allows for flexibility in choosing the communication protocol based on the specific requirements and capabilities of the Qdrant deployment.  Defaults to `False`.

- **prefix:** It allows the user to add a prefix to the REST URL path when making API requests. By specifying a prefix, the user can customize the URL structure for the REST API endpoints. For example, if the user set the prefix parameter to "service/v1", the resulting URL for the REST API would be:

    ```HTML
    "http://localhost:6333/service/v1/{qdrant-endpoint}"
    ```

    This can be useful for organizing and categorizing different API endpoints within the user application.

- **search_kwargs:** This parameter is used to specify additional search options or filters when querying the database. It allows the user to customize the search behavior and retrieve more specific results. Defaults to {}.  Defaults to `{}`.

- **timeout:** It is used to specify the maximum time in seconds that a request can take before it times out. If a request takes longer than the specified timeout, it will be canceled and an error will be returned. This parameter is useful for controlling the maximum waiting time for a request and preventing it from blocking indefinitely.

- **url:** This parameter specifies the URL of the Qdrant service that the user wants to connect to. It is required to provide the URL to establish a connection with the Qdrant server. The URL should point to the location where the Qdrant service is running, whether it is a local instance, an on-premise server, or a Qdrant Cloud cluster. The URL parameter allows the user to connect to the desired Qdrant instance and access its functionality through the API.
