### PromptTemplate


Schema to represent a prompt for an LLM.

A `PromptTemplate` refers to a reproducible way to generate a prompt. It contains a text string called "the template" that can take in a set of parameters from the end user and generates a prompt. A prompt template can include instructions to the language model, a set of few-shot examples to help the language model generate a better response, and a question to the language model. It provides a flexible way to create prompts for language models.


- **template:** Template used to format an individual request.
