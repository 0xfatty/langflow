## Inputs and Outputs of Components

Langflow 1.0 introduces changes to the way inputs and outputs of components are handled. Learn about the new input and output definitions and how they affect your components.

[Learn more about Inputs and Outputs of Components](../guides/inputs-and-outputs)

## From Composition to Flow of Data

The composition model has been replaced with a more intuitive flow of data. Discover how this change impacts your projects and how to adapt your existing compositions to the new paradigm.

[Learn more about the Flow of Data](../guides/flow-of-data)

## Continued Support for LangChain and Multiple Frameworks

Langflow 1.0 continues to support LangChain while also introducing support for multiple frameworks. Find out how to leverage the power of different frameworks in your projects.

[Learn more about Supported Frameworks](../guides/supported-frameworks)

## Sidebar Redesign and Customizable Interaction Panel

The sidebar has undergone a small redesign, with more changes planned for the future. Additionally, the interaction panel is now customizable based on the components in your flow. Explore the new sidebar and learn how to customize the interaction panel to suit your needs.

[Learn more about the Sidebar and Interaction Panel](../guides/sidebar-and-interaction-panel)

## New Native Categories and Components

Langflow 1.0 introduces many new native categories, including Inputs, Outputs, Helpers, Experimental, Models, and more. Discover the new components available, such as Chat Input, Prompt, Files, API Request, and others.

[Learn more about New Categories and Components](../guides/new-categories-and-components)

## New Way of Using Langflow: Text and Record

With the introduction of Text and Record modes (and more to come), you can now see each step of the flow in action. Learn how to use these new modes to gain a better understanding of your flow's execution.

[Learn more about Text and Record](../guides/text-and-record)

## CustomComponent for All Components

Almost all components in Langflow 1.0 are now CustomComponents, allowing you to check and modify the code of each component. Discover how to leverage this feature to customize your components to your specific needs.

[Learn more about CustomComponent](../guides/custom-component)

## Compatibility with Previous Versions

To use flows built in previous versions of Langflow, you can utilize the experimental component Runnable Executor along with an Input and Output. Learn how to adapt your existing flows to work seamlessly in the new version of Langflow.

[Learn more about Compatibility with Previous Versions](../guides/compatibility)

## Multiple Flows in the Canvas

Langflow 1.0 allows you to have more than one flow in the canvas and run them separately. Discover how to create and manage multiple flows within a single project.

[Learn more about Multiple Flows](../guides/multiple-flows)

## Improved Component Status and Data Passing Visualization

Each component now displays its status more clearly, and you can see the data being passed between them. Learn how to interpret the improved status indicators and data passing visualization.

[Learn more about Component Status and Data Passing](../guides/component-status-and-data-passing)

## Connecting Output Components

You can now connect Output components to any other component, providing a better understanding of the data flow. Explore the possibilities of connecting Output components and how it enhances your flow's functionality.

[Learn more about Connecting Output Components](../guides/connecting-output-components)

## Renaming and Editing Component Descriptions

Langflow 1.0 allows you to rename and edit the description of each component, making it easier to understand and interact with the flow. Learn how to customize your component names and descriptions for improved clarity.

[Learn more about Renaming and Editing Components](../guides/renaming-and-editing-components)

## Passing Tweaks and Inputs in the API

You can now pass tweaks and inputs in the API by referencing the Display Name of the component. Discover how to leverage this feature to dynamically control your flow's behavior.

[Learn more about Passing Tweaks and Inputs](../guides/passing-tweaks-and-inputs)

## Global Variables for Text Fields

Langflow 1.0 introduces Global Variables that can be used in any Text Field across your projects. Learn how to define and utilize Global Variables to streamline your workflow.

[Learn more about Global Variables](../guides/global-variables)

## Experimental Components

Explore the experimental components available in Langflow 1.0, such as SubFlow, which allows you to load a flow as a component dynamically, and Flow as Tool, which enables you to use a flow as a tool for an Agent.

[Learn more about Experimental Components](../guides/experimental-components)

## Experimental State Management System

Langflow 1.0 introduces an experimental State Management system that allows components to trigger other components and pass messages between them using the Notify and Listen components. Discover how to leverage this system to create more dynamic and interactive flows.

[Learn more about State Management](../guides/state-management)

## Run Flow: A Simplified SubFlow Alternative

Run Flow is a less complex version of the SubFlow component, providing a simpler way to incorporate flows within your projects. Learn how to use Run Flow to streamline your flow composition.

[Learn more about Run Flow](../guides/run-flow)
